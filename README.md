# Bunnies - cuddly functional programming in Golang!
_Bunnies_ is a library to support functional programming with Go 1.18 Generics, providing basic building blocks and types for a more type-safe, boiler-plate free and functional experience.

What is supported, and the roadmap is in the `TODO` list below.

### Why the name "Bunnies"?
Scala has the excellent [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) library. Cats are cute. Bunnies are also cute. Why not pick a name for something equally cute, based on the loose inspiration for the library?

### TODO
- [x] `List` (just slice)
- [x] `Option`
- [ ] `Either`
- [ ] `NonEmptyList`
- [ ] `IO`
- [ ] `Validation`
